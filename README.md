# Boosting-Crowd-Counting-via-Multifaceted-Attention
Official Implement of CVPR 2022 paper 'Boosting Crowd Counting via Multifaceted Attention'

This version replaces VGG19 with a Swin-Large backbone (2+2+18+2 = 24
attention blocks). The stage-4 feature is projected from 1536 to 512 channels
and passed to the original multibatch MAN Transformer encoder and density-map
head. The original Bayesian and cosine-consistency losses remain in use.
The CCST count head and CCST trainer are not used.

## Train

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. By default,
`python train.py` first trains the full 24-block baseline on `SHA/clean/train`
and selects its best checkpoint on `SHA/clean/val`. It then freezes that
baseline and trains Q/V DoRA in all 24 Swin attention blocks on
`SHA/hazy/train`, selecting the best result on `SHA/mix/val`. The MAN head
and custom Transformer stay frozen during DoRA training.

With the default `qv` targets, DoRA learns a low-rank Q/V direction update
and a separate magnitude for every Q/V output vector; K remains unchanged. The magnitude is initialized
from the clean baseline, so attaching DoRA does not change the model output
before adaptation starts. The parallel DoRA1 branch is present but frozen
during this stage and is never called by the DoRA forward route.

### Attention projection ablation

`train.py --dora-targets` selects **q, k, v, o, qk, qv, or qkvo**
(case insensitive; default: `qv`). Q/K/V are independently adapted slices of
`attn.qkv`; O is the attention output projection `attn.proj`. Every selected
projection in every Swin block shares the same `--dora-rank` and
`--dora-alpha`. Swin-T has 12 blocks. Original model weights, biases, the MAN
encoder, and density head remain frozen during DoRA training. DoRA1 has an independent `--dora1-targets` selector with the same seven choices
(default: `qv`), plus its own `--dora1-rank` and `--dora1-alpha`. The two
branches need not select the same projections or use the same rank/alpha.
Each branch applies its settings uniformly across its selected projections.
Only the active branch is evaluated or trained.

```bash
python train.py --model-name swin_t_trans --stage dora \
  --baseline-checkpoint /path/to/baseline/best_model.pth \
  --dora-targets qkvo --dora-rank 8 --dora-alpha 16
```

To train DoRA1 independently from an existing DoRA checkpoint:

```bash
python train.py --model-name swin_t_trans --stage dora1 \
  --dora-checkpoint /path/to/dora/best_model.pth \
  --dora-targets qv --dora-rank 4 --dora-alpha 4 \
  --dora1-targets qkvo --dora1-rank 8 --dora1-alpha 16
```

DoRA settings must match the trained checkpoint. Starting DoRA1 initializes a
fresh branch from the frozen baseline, so its targets and rank/alpha may differ
from the inactive DoRA1 stored in a DoRA-stage checkpoint. Resuming an existing
DoRA1 run instead requires both branches' settings to match. Evaluation reads
both target selectors from metadata; for older `.pth` files without metadata,
supply both selectors explicitly (`qv` for historical Q/V branches).

For the seven ablations, change only `--dora-targets`; use the same baseline,
rank/alpha, data, seed, and training budget for every configuration. The number
of trainable parameters is logged alongside the selected targets.

Epoch `.tar` checkpoints store adapter settings. Newly saved best `.pth`
weights retain the existing state-dict format and have a companion
`best_model.pth.json` containing settings. Keep both files together: training
and evaluation automatically read this metadata, and resume validates the
adapter settings. Resuming `.pth` starts with a fresh optimizer; `.tar` resumes
optimizer and epoch state. Older `.pth` files without metadata require matching
rank/alpha and targets supplied explicitly (old Q/V checkpoints use `qv`).

```bash
python test.py --model-name swin_t_trans --router-mode fixed \
  --baseline-checkpoint /path/to/baseline/best_model.pth \
  --dora-checkpoint /path/to/dora/best_model.pth --dora1-checkpoint '' \
  --dora-targets qkvo --dora-rank 8 --dora-alpha 16
```

The optional third stage trains a second DoRA branch named DoRA1 in parallel
with the trained DoRA branch. Both branches read the same frozen baseline projection
weights, and exactly one branch is evaluated per forward. During DoRA1 training,
the baseline and complete DoRA branch are frozen and DoRA is not called; only
DoRA1's direction and magnitude parameters are optimized. Both branches start
from the clean baseline output. Original projection weights, the MAN encoder, and the density head are
shared and frozen. Each branch adapts only its selected projections.

```bash
python train.py
python train.py --stage baseline
python train.py --stage dora \
  --baseline-checkpoint model/swin_l_trans/baseline/RUN/best_model.pth

# Third stage: freeze baseline + DoRA and train only the DoRA1 branch.
python train.py --stage dora1 \
  --dora-checkpoint model/swin_t_trans/dora/RUN/best_model.pth \
  --dora1-train-dir /path/to/night/train \
  --dora1-val-dir /path/to/day/val \
  --dora-rank 4 --dora-alpha 4 \
  --dora1-rank 4 --dora1-alpha 4

# Run all three stages in sequence.
python train.py --stage all \
  --dora1-train-dir /path/to/night/train \
  --dora1-val-dir /path/to/day/val
```

The default training crop is **256×256**. The official ImageNet-22K
`swin_large_patch4_window12_384_22k.pth` is read from `pre_models/`, or from
`--pretrained-path`. Its filename describes pretraining; it does not set this
project's input size. The 12×12 Swin attention windows are padded as needed
for 256×256 crops. `--no-pretrained-backbone` starts from random weights.
The optional `--model-name swin_t_trans` retains the earlier 12-block Swin-T
model; the default `swin_l_trans` has 24 blocks.

Dataset paths can be changed with `--data-dir`, `--dora-train-dir`,
`--dora-val-dir`, `--dora1-train-dir`, and `--dora1-val-dir`. The adapter
directory names are explicit, so experiments such as night training and day
validation do not depend on the runtime route names. Each split contains
`.jpg` images and matching `.npy` point
annotations. `--resume <epoch_ckpt.tar>` continues the selected stage; with
the default `--stage both`, it resumes the baseline before DoRA starts.

Training and validation progress are displayed with tqdm. TensorBoard scalar
logs are stored under `model/<model-name>/<stage>/<run>/tensorboard/` and can be viewed with:

```
tensorboard --logdir model
```

Epoch numbers shown in logs, progress bars, TensorBoard, and checkpoint names
are 1-based. The two stages have separate schedules:

| Stage | Epochs | Validate every | First validation index |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Clean baseline | `--pretrain-epochs 500` | `--pretrain-val-epoch 5` | `--pretrain-val-start 100` |
| Hazy/mix DoRA | `--dora-epochs 1200` | `--dora-val-epoch 5` | `--dora-val-start 500` |

The validation starts are **zero-based**. With these defaults, baseline first
validates after epoch 101 and DoRA first validates after epoch 501. `--max-epoch`,
`--val-epoch`, and `--val-start` are aliases for the three DoRA options.


## Test

```bash
python test.py --data-root SHA --split val \
  --baseline-checkpoint model/swin_l_trans/baseline/RUN/best_model.pth \
  --dora-checkpoint model/swin_l_trans/dora/RUN/best_model.pth \
  --dora1-checkpoint model/swin_l_trans/dora1/RUN/best_model.pth \
  --dora-rank 4 --dora-alpha 4 \
  --dora1-rank 4 --dora1-alpha 4 \
  --dual-route dora1
```

To route every mixed-set image by its filename, use a DoRA1-stage dual-DoRA
checkpoint. Files named `IMG_*` use the baseline+DoRA1 branch, while files named
`night_IMG_*` use the baseline+DoRA branch. The summary CSV contains overall
MAE/RMSE; the routing CSV records the selected branch and count error for every
image.

```bash
python test.py \
  --model-name swin_t_trans \
  --router-mode filename \
  --data-root /home/mmslab-1080/Desktop/img2img-turbo/SHA \
  --domains mix --split val \
  --dora1-checkpoint /path/to/dora1/best_model.pth \
  --output-csv filename_router_summary.csv \
  --routing-csv filename_router_details.csv
```

Filename routing evaluates only the dual-DoRA checkpoint; separate baseline and
DoRA checkpoint arguments are not needed in this mode.

### Image-content day/night router

Train the MobileNetV3-Small router with filename-derived labels. Filenames are
used only as training/validation targets; the trained router receives image
pixels only.

```bash
python train_router.py \
  --data-root /home/mmslab-1080/Desktop/img2img-turbo/SHA/mix \
  --epochs 20 --batch-size 32 --device cuda:0
```

Use its best checkpoint for content-based dynamic routing. The router resizes a
separate copy to 224x224; the crowd-counting input keeps its original size.

```bash
python test.py \
  --model-name swin_t_trans \
  --router-mode classifier \
  --router-checkpoint model/day_night_router/RUN/best_model.pth \
  --data-root /home/mmslab-1080/Desktop/img2img-turbo/SHA \
  --domains mix --split val \
  --dora1-checkpoint /path/to/dora1/best_model.pth \
  --output-csv classifier_router_summary.csv \
  --routing-csv classifier_router_details.csv
```

The routing CSV includes the filename-derived expected domain for evaluation,
the image-router prediction and confidence, the selected adapter, and the count
error. Runtime branch selection remains:

- predicted day -> baseline + DoRA1
- predicted night -> baseline + DoRA

Epoch `.tar` checkpoints contain stage, model name, optimizer, and both adapter
settings. Best `.pth` checkpoints contain model weights; supply the DoRA and
DoRA1 rank/alpha values when loading a parallel `.pth` checkpoint. The active
route is selected at runtime and is not stored as a learned parameter.
